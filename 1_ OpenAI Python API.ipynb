    "Giving the AI brain a unique set of instructions to increase its intelligence and responsiveness is what AI prompt engineering entails. To comprehend what we want from AI models like ChatGPT or GPT-4, they need to be gently nudged in the right direction. Prompt engineering can help with it. The finest answers from the AI may be ensured by carefully structuring the prompts. Now, prompt engineering doesn’t only happen once. The process of adjusting and experimenting is continuing. When we ask the AI a question, we experiment with varied wording and the addition of unique rules. We seem to be concocting a miraculous concoction of instructions! Let’s take a look at some rules to construct good prompts to generate accurate results for AI.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Some Rules of Prompt Engineering\n",
    "Rule 1: Use latest AI models for your tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to use latest AI models, because AI models do not tend to give accurate results when they are not updated with recent data. For example, ChatGPT was trained on data dated till September 2021 so it won’t be able to provide you with information after September 2021. Whereas, GPT-4 (or ChatGPT plus) is trained on latest data and is able to generate latest information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rule 2: Start your prompt with Instructions, and use “”” or ### to separate your input from your instruction.\n",

    "\n",
    "file [required]: The audio file to transcribe, in one of these formats: mp3, mp4, mpeg, mpga, m4a, wav, or webm.\n",
    "model [required]: ID of the model to use. Only whisper-1 is currently available.\n",
    "prompt [optional]: An optional text to guide the model’s style or continue a previous audio segment. The prompt should match the audio language.\n",
    "response_format [optional]: The format of the transcript output, in one of these options: json, text, srt, verbose_json, or vtt.\n",
    "temperature [optional]: The sampling temperature, between 0 and 1. Higher values like 0.8 will make the output more random, while lower values like 0.2 will make it more focused and deterministic. If set to 0, the model will use log probability to automatically increase the temperature until certain thresholds are hit.\n",
    "language [optional]: The language of the input audio. Supplying the input language in ISO-639-1 format will improve accuracy and latency."
